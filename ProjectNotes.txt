Progress check points

--> Uploaded the terraform code  to provision ec2 instance  : Kalyan will review it and change the names
--> uplaoded sample ansible-docercoompose file 


work pending

as per my understanding , we can work on  point hilighted in bold below

Batch-4 Project Details
Springboot with Mongo DB
You are expected to prepare design and implementation plan to onboard two
tenants on k8s and OpenShift with sample application comprising of two
microservices (SpringBoot with MongoDB), use ArgoCD (on K8s) and S2I pipeline
(on OpenShift) for deploying Sample project, Use ELK stack for monitoring
application with below flow.


---> Use Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure such as Kubernetes
cluster, EC2 instances

- Use Ansible to configure provisioned Infrastructure*  : K8s Pending  -- Veera

Use GitHub/Gitlab repos to store source code and pipeline files and Apply
appropriate Branching and Security Policies   -------> clarify with RAMESH 

- Docker File and the use docker-compose to automate image creation
process - store images in Docker hub  ---> Nikita will try to complete  and hadnover to jamie 
 
- Use of helm charts for k8s package management    

- Deploy ingress Controller in K8s to access the applications ---> 

Launch Microservices using S2I concept of OpenShift   

Use Persistent storage  --> openshift ---> to store the data --> yaml files for our project 

Use Network policies to isolate applications --> same yamls files peneshift and k8s both 

Monitor applications using ELK/EFK stack on OpenShift   

Notes :- 

CI using jenkins  --> provision the infra , build the images , store  the images in docker hub 

Argo CD -->  yaml files git hub and deploy in kubernetes 

S2I -->
