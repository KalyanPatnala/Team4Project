Batch-4 Project Details
Springboot with Mongo DB
You are expected to prepare design and implementation plan to onboard two
tenants on k8s and OpenShift with sample application comprising of two
microservices (SpringBoot with MongoDB), use ArgoCD (on K8s) and S2I pipeline
(on OpenShift) for deploying Sample project, Use ELK stack for monitoring
application with below flow.
-Use Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure such as Kubernetes
cluster, EC2 instances*
- Use Ansible to configure provisioned Infrastructure*

Use GitHub/Gitlab repos to store source code and pipeline files and Apply
appropriate Branching and Security Policies

- Docker File and the use docker-compose to automate image creation
process - store images in Docker hub*

Use of helm charts for k8s package management

- Deploy ingress Controller in K8s to access the applications*

Launch Microservices using S2I concept of OpenShift

- Use Persistent storage*
- Use Network policies to isolate applications**

Monitor applications using ELK/EFK stack on OpenShift
